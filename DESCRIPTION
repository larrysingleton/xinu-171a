This is the SECOND version of Xinu for CSCI 8530, and includes the code base
needed for the second programming assignment. Specifically it differs from the
previous (xinu-171) distribution as follows:

1. The files system/gpio-i2c.c, include/gpio-i2c.h, include/galileo-gen-defs.h,
   wnd shell/xsh_blink.c have been added. 

2. The file shell/shell.c has been modified to add the appropriate entry for
   the blink command.

3. The file shprototypes.h has been modified to include the prototype for the
   xsh_blink function.

4. The file include/kernel.h ha2 been modified to add a few type definitions.

5. This DESCRIPTION file has been modified.

To verify you have a correct version of the distribution, it is recommended
that you:

1. Install the software distribution in a suitable directory structure, usually
   named xinu-171 when you unpack to gzipped tar file (xinu-171a.tar.gz).
2. Change the working directory to compile.
3. Execute the commands "make clean;make rebuild;make depend;make" to rebuild
   everything.
4. Download xinu.elf to your microSD card.
5. Boot xinu.
6. Try running the blink command. For example, "blink 10" should cause an LED
   on the Galileo board next to the USH Host connector to go on and off 10
   times with a 500 millisecond interval.

Read the source code of xsh_blink.c for additional information.

This directory holds Xinu sources for the Galileo. This version is specifically
for students in CSCI 8530 at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. It is the
initial version for the Spring 2017 semester.

It is a modification of the Purdue Xinu distribution for the Galileo.
Specifically, it deals with the possibility that (a) there is no Ethernet link,
or (b) there is Ethernet but no DHCP server, or (c) the user uses the
netstatus command to shut down the networking.

It also has vacuous versions of the swait and ssignal system functions (in the
expected files), and an implemention of a solution to the Dining Philosopers 
problem using swait and ssignal. Of course it won't work correctly until those
system calls are written. Implementation of those system calls may, or may not,
be assigned during the Spring 2017 semester.

The mklfs command is provided to build a local filesystem on the RAM disk.
A few additional commands are provided to manipulate files, along with a
few extensions to the LFS devices.

Multiple timeserver IP addresses are defined in net/dhcp.c. These are used in
getutime, in the order given, as needed in case of timeouts. The IP addresses
can obviously be changed as desired.

This version has the UECHO device (which should eventually be renamed).

A simple BASIC interpreter is provided.

A simple line-oriented text editor calle "e0" is provided.

A TFTP ("Trivial File Transfer Protocol") client is provided.

The "reboot" command is provided, and works with Galileo Gen 1 and Gen 2.
